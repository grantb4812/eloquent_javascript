Data Sets
    Array
        is used to store a sequence of values
        var array =[one, two, three]
        
        array[i] 
        
        array's are given index begin with 0
        
        to access a value of an array you would used
        array[i]  where i is representing which index
        
        this would return the contents held at the index
        
        any type can be stored in an array
        
Properties

    almost all javascript values contain properties with the exception being null
    and undefined
    
    examples would be string.length or Math.max
    
    we can access properties with either dot notation or bracket notation
    
    string.length or string["length"]
    
    if bracket notation is used javascript will evaluate the expression and use that 
    as the property
    
    if the property your trying to access is not a valid variable name you have to use 
    bracket notation
    
    all elements in array are stored as properties of that array
    
Methods

    methods 
        properties that contain functions
        
        these would be considered methods of the value they belong to
        
        string.toLowerCase and string.toUpperCase would be methods of type string
        
        array methods
            push 
                used to add values to the end of an array
            pop
                used to remove a value from the end of an array
                
            join
                used to join string within an array
                
        these are just a few examples of methods of array
        
Objects

    collections of properties that can be added or removed
    
    brace notation is one way of creating an object
    
    var object = {
        prop1: value,
        prop2: value
    }
    
    properties have to be seperated by commas
    
    names that arent valid variables or number have to be quoted ""
    
    retrieving a property that doesnt exist will return undefined
    
    you can also assign a property using the = operator, if the propert value currently
    exist it will be replaced and if not a new property on the object will be created
    
    the delete operator is a unary operator that will remove the specified property
    
    delete object.prop
    
    you can use the in operator to see if a value exist in an object
    
    "prop" in object
    
    arrays are a specialized type of an object used for storing information in sequence
    
    typeof [] will return object
    
Mutability

    immutable
        types of value number, string, and booleans are all immutable,
        meaning that their you cant change an existing value of these types
        
        objects though are considered to be mutable because their value can be 
        modified by changing its properties
        
        if comparing objects == will only return true if the objects are refering the 
        same object
        
        such as 
        
        var obj1 = {val: 1};
        var obj2 = obj1;
        var obj3 = {val: 1};
        
        obj1 == obj2  true
        obj1 == obj3 false
        
        because obj2 refers to obj1 any changes to obj1 will be reflected in obj 2
        obj3 can hold the exact same values but will not be equal 
        
        correlation
            is a measure of dependence between variables in the sense of mathmatics
            
Objects as maps

    map
        is a way to go from values in one domain to corresponding values in 
        another domain
        
    we can loop through an object using a for construct 
    
    for (var prop in obj) {
        console.log(obj[prop]);
    }
        
        
        
more about arrays

    methods used for adding or removing things at the beginning of an array
    
    unshift and shift
        shift is used to remove things from the front of an array
        
        unshift will add to the front of an array
    
    indexOf
    
        will search for a property starting at the beginning
        
    lastIndexOf 
    
        will start searching at the end
        
    slice 
    
        is used to return array that has the elements between a specified set of 
        indexes
        
    concat
        is similar to the + operators but for array propertties
        
Strings and their properties

    you cannot set new properties on string 
    
    strings also have .slice and indexOf properties with string you can pass more than one
    character to indexOf
    
    trim
        removes any white space
        
    charAt 
        can access individual characters
        
the arguments object

    when a functio is called it creates a variable named arguments and adds it to the 
    environment that the function body runs in 
    
    this refers to an object that holds all the arguments that where passed to the 
    function
    
    this does have a lenght property and names each property as 0,1,2 according to the 
    arguments passed
    
    it however does not have any array methods available to it
    
    this is used in cases such as console.log and essentially will loop through arguments[i]
    to display
    
The Math object

    .max
    
    .min
    
    .sqrt
    
    the math object is used as a container to group related functionality and there is 
    only one it provides a namespace so that the functions and values are not global variables

    having to many global variables pollutes the name space and creates problems down the line
    
    refer to this section Math methods
    
The global object

    each global variable created is essentially a property of the global object
    
    in the case of the browser the global scope object is stored in the window variable
